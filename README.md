# real-world_phenomenon
Project - Programming for Data Analysis

## RESEARCH

This project consists on find the best match between operational costs x passengers transported according to the time schedule between each stop

SCOPE:
The total length contains 20 stops and the ticket cost is $3.00

In order to simulate a time schedule, the dataframe values will be changed, from 40 people to 90 people boarding (5/5 min) and from 50 people to 120 people boarding (10/10 min)

Then, based on the number of passengers transported at the end of 18 hours (supposing this is the functional time frame that our trains operates) and the number of journeys performed, it will be defined what is the most profitable schedule: 5/5 min or 10/10 min
All tasks regarding to this project can be found into the jupyter notebook called Real_World_Phenomenon.ipynb
